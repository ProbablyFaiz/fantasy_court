## Commands
- Run all tests: `cd backend && pytest`
- Run frontend typechecking: `just typecheck`
- Run backend (Python) tests: `just test-backend`
    - Run single test file: `just test-backend <path to test file relative to backend/>` e.g., `just test-backend test/api/test_tasks_api.py`
- Run frontend (TS) tests: `just test-frontend`
    - Run single test file: `just test-frontend <path to test file relative to frontend/>` e.g., `just test-frontend src/features/home/HomePage.test.tsx`

- Format code: `just lint`
  - Often helpful to run this after making large code changes.
- Generate OpenAPI client: `just openapi` (regenerates frontend/src/client from running API)
- Generate (but do not run) DB migrations based on changes to backend/court/db/models.py: `just migrate "message"` (auto-generate)
    - Please use `just migrate` and then modify the alembic migration as necessary, do not try to create one from scratch manually.
    - Remember when creating migrations for non-nullable columns that if they are for an existing table, you will probably need to
    modify the migration to first create the column as nullable, initialize the column's values appropriately, and then set it to
    non-nullable.
- Add a shadcn/ui component: `just shadd <component>` (equivalent to `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>`)
- You should not, unless instructed, run the API or frontend dev servers; the developer is almost certainly already running them, and you doing so will just be harmful. Especially important: you have a tendency to run the dev server after making changes. Do NOT do this.

Note that, as shown, to run code in the backend Python environment, one must run `uv run <your python command>`
inside the `backend/` directory. The `just` shortcuts handle this for you when they are available.

YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED FROM EXECUTING THE MIGRATION YOU HAVE GENERATED YOURSELF. DO NOT RUN `just migrate-up` OR
`alembic upgrade ...` or `alembic downgrade ...` UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. IF RUNNING A MIGRATION IS NECESSARY FOR THE
CONTINUATION OF WORK, ASK THE USER TO PERFORM IT.
